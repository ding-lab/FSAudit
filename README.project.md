For development were linking to data in run ../../dat

To do for development: test functionality of `src/summarize_fs.R` by calling
directly via `Rscript`.  In particular, 
* evaluate flags `-D bad.fs` to investigate bad data 
* evaluate -g group.by to enable workflows which do bubble plots vs. volume

Another issue is how to have links to the latest data, timestamp notwithstanding
