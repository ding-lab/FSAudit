Step 2 may fail for very large systems with a bus error.  This appears to be due to memory, and seems to happen
  when running on a blade.  Exiting to the login node, or running with larger memory, seems to resolve this
Explicitly write log name when reporting permission denied errors
Write disk usage stats in title
Directories should be consolidated so that can scan multiple disk volumes more easily (e.g., overnight run)

TODO:
* starting this is pretty tedious, since need to edit FSAudit.config file (to change timestamp) and possibly git stash && git pull && git stash pop
in every directory.  It would be much better to define a list of directories and their attributes in a configuration file in a central place,
then iterate over this file to analyze each directory in turn.  The BICSEQ2 script above has a model of how to do this
* bsub submission is not implemented, which may be preferred on MGI, but which is not necessary
* no provision currently exists to pull all resulting images back into one location.
* It would be good to report on disk usage (du -h) for each volume, to update the FSAudit catalog 
* Logs need to go to a central place - save the number of permissions errors
* make a summary of usage by user and volume, similar to what is being done here:   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K3eA3ApWaemksx3oQofgaw9zSZ79qFPeTCm_zrdsE8E/edit#gid=1042458463
  this needs to be automated to pick out problem areas
* In plot, order users in alphabetical order
* All output of FSAudit_parallel.sh must go to file, so errors can be caught
* test for existence of all relevant executibles when starting up: python3, parallel, Rscript
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6141581/detect-python-version-in-shell-script
* quickly find core files
* Create disk space and file count figures with users on one axis, volumes on another.
